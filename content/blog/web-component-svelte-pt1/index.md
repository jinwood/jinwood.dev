I'm going to build a "Spotify Top Artists" web component using Svelete.js, and document the process here.

Motivations:

- A nice lil project to keep me busy in the evenings
- I like music and Spotify
- I like Svelte
- I'd like to use the component on this site (because why not)

Goals:

A simple, standalone component, that interacts with the Spotify API to fetch the given users top artists (all time).
