        <p>
          I'm an experienced web developer and have worked across a variety of
          stacks, in various industries. I started my career in the Microsoft
          ecosystem with ASP.NET but have since transitioned to a more
          JavaScript orientated path. With that said, I am interested in any and
          all tech stacks but with a focus on JavaScript. Hi, I'm Julian Inwood.
          I'm a software engineer and a writer. I'm currently
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I enjoy using both Mac and Linux, my workflow consists of both command
          line tools (vim, grep, fsf) and VS Code. If you're interested you can
          see my dotfiles here.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Currently I am working with react, redux and Angular 9 during the day,
          and Svelte at home. I'm experienced with C# .NET and spent the first
          few years of my software career building web apps using this
          technology. Although currently my preference is with the JavaScript /
          node ecosystem, I am interested in any and all web technologies.
