          <p>
            I'm an experienced web developer and have worked across a variety of
            stacks, in various industries. I started my career in the Microsoft
            ecosystem with ASP.NET but have since transitioned to a more
            JavaScript orientated path. With that said, I am interested in any
            and all tech stacks but with a focus on JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy using both Mac and Linux, my workflow consists of both
            command line tools (vim, grep, fsf) and VS Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am working with react, redux and Angular 9 during the
            day, and Svelte at home. I'm experienced with C# .NET and spent the
            first few years of my software career building web apps using this
            technology. Although currently my preference is with the JavaScript
            / node ecosystem, I am interested in any and all web technologies.
