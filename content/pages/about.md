Lifelong nerd, tech enthusiast and self taught web developer.

_Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu is a great way to keep fit, focus the mind and improve your self-defense._

I've been working in web development since 2013, where I began my career building web apps with ASP.Net web forms. Since then I've built APIs, mobile apps, caseworking software, telephony interfaces, and recently PWAs. I originally focused on the Microsoft tech stack, but now my passion is in open source technology and UNIX operating systems. My work laptop is a Mac, but I use Linux at home. I'm passionate about the web, online privacy, and technology in general.

I'm self taught, and have a broad interest in web technology. Recently I've been working with **react.js**, **flow**, **redux** and **graphql** but I am interested in any and all web stacks.

I use and love vim, and change editor themes weekly (I can't help it).

Outside of work, I practise Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, listen to a ton of music and play video games.
