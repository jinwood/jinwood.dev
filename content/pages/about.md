_Donec eu libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo. Quisque sit amet est et sapien ullamcorper pharetra. Vestibulum erat wisi, condimentum sed, commodo vitae, ornare sit amet, wisi._

I've been working in web development since 2013, where I began my career building web apps with ASP.Net web forms. Since then I've built APIs, mobile apps, caseworking software, telephony interfaces, and recently PWAs. I originally focused on the Microsoft tech stack, but now my passion is in open source technology and UNIX operating systems. My work laptop is a Mac, but I use Linux at home. I'm passionate about the web, online privacy, and technology in general.

I'm self taught, and have a broad interest in web technology. Recently I've been working with **react.js**, **flow**, **redux** and **graphql** but I am interested in any and all web stacks.
